  - Always want to be the first to experience new and unique things (It feels like I got something that other people were waiting for)
- Quite shy 😳
  
## My favorite
- Information technology and things related to computers. 
  - Because I was fascinated by games and interesting things due to being exposed to computers at school or my sister's since kindergarten.
- A little understanding of software technology
  - Except for things related to microchips, hard drives,... it looks quite complicated
- Reading books 📚
  - I have not confirmed that I like reading books, but if given enough time to interact with books, I can read them attentively.
 
# My Knowledge level of programming programs

  - It must be called an extremely basic level
