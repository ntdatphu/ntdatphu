# 😉 Who I am?
> 🪪 My name is **Nguyễn Trần Đạt Phú**</br>
>🎂 My birthday is on the **12/27/2006** *(I'm **Capricorn**)* </br>
> 🌐 I'm Vietnamese </br>
> 😳 A shy boy
  
## 😀 My character
Rarely talk to people but chatting online is a bit "extroverted"
> People often say that I can hang out with anyone, but I'm not close

🙄 I can only read and understand the basics in English and am not really proficient at it. I need to try a lot harder in learning foreign languages. </br>
✨ Slightly OCD </br>
🤓 Always like to discover new things on technology devices, like right now I always want to explore artificial intelligence.
Always want to be the first to experience new and unique things (It feels like I got something that other people were waiting for)
  
## 😌 Favorite
> 💻 Information technology and things related to computers. </br>
> 🤓 Because I was fascinated by games and interesting things due to being exposed to computers at school or my sister's since kindergarten. </br>
> ⚙️ A little understanding of software technology </br>
> Except for things related to microchips, hard drives,... it looks quite complicated </br>
